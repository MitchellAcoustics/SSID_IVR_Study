  In September 2021, a significant jump in seismic activity on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) signaled the start of a volcanic crisis that still continues at the time of writing. Earthquake data is continually collected and published by the Instituto Geográphico Nacional (IGN). ...

  Earthquake data for the island of La Palma from the September 2021 eruption is found ...
key-points:
  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis
  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.

# Introduction


Making a change here.

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every  years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.

# Results
## Perception

The preliminary results reveal a good coverage of the two-dimensional perceptual circumplex space and significant differences between perceptual outcomes driven by sound and those driven by visual stimuli. The perceptual outcomes in the two-dimensional circumplex space were calculated from the eight scales, relying on the recommendations outlined in the ISO/TS 12913-3(13) and visualised in the Figure 2 using the Soundscapy tool (8)

## Participants
## Task

The experiment consisted of three blocks within which the 27 stimuli were presented in random order, including a neutral grey environment without any sounds being reproduced which represented the baseline scenario. First block featured only auditory stimuli with a neutral grey environment presented in the HMD, the second block featured only 15s long video samples similar to (12), while the third block featured both audio and visual recordings combined. The participants were advised to take frequent breaks, one within each block but more were allowed upon request.

## Laboratory setup

The experiment was conducted in a listening chamber featuring twelve coaxial active speakers (Genelec 8331) arranged to provide Second Order Ambisonic playback, while the visual stimuli were delivered via an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Head-Mounted Display (HMD), as shown in Figure 1. The participant was required to be sitting on a highchair with their head in a “sweet spot” – as close as possible to the point that is equally distant from the centre of all the twelve speakers.
The questionnaire was deployed within the IVR simulation created in Unity and operated by a participant via joystick.

## Pilot experiment

Two pilot experiments were conducted: 1) Investigating the applicability of the Method A questionnaire to assess the perceived affective quality of the video scenes without the audio stimuli (12); 2) Optimising the stimuli selection to cover the full circumplex model associated with the eight dimensions employed in the Method A.
The first pilot experiment featured 39 different scenes and revealed a good coverage of the calm and eventful space. The annoying and uneventful dimensions were not covered which could mean that either visual context cannot generate a monotonous outcome in an urban space, or that the dataset is missing more stimuli that would address that segment of the circumplex space (12).
This led to further twelve field recordings made specifically to target the annoying, monotonous and uneventful area of the circumplex model.

### Stimuli selection

The second pilot study was focused on providing three scenes per each section of the circumplex space in a three by three matrix. Three researchers conducted independent assessments of the 51 videos (the combined audio and video condition) to select the most representative 27 stimuli. After the independent assessment, the outcome was discussed until an agreement was reached. The selected scenes are presented in Table 1.
