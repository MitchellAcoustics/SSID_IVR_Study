\begin{abstract}
In September 2021, a significant jump in seismic activity on the island
of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) signaled the start of a volcanic
crisis that still continues at the time of writing. Earthquake data is
continually collected and published by the Instituto Geográphico
Nacional (IGN). \ldots{}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Making a change here.

Based on data up to and including 1971 \textcite{Mitchell2022How},
eruptions on La Palma happen every years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as
\textcite{marrero2019}, have proposed that there are two main magma
reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km
depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir
(10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s
(\textbf{?@fig-timeline}).

Data and methods are discussed in Section~\ref{sec-data-methods}.

Let \(x\) denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, \(x\) can be
modeled by a Poisson distribution

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-poisson}{
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
}\end{equation}

where \(\lambda\) is the rate of eruptions per year. Using
Equation~\ref{eq-poisson}, the probability of an eruption in the next
\(t\) years can be calculated.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Perception}\label{perception}

The preliminary results reveal a good coverage of the two-dimensional
perceptual circumplex space and significant differences between
perceptual outcomes driven by sound and those driven by visual stimuli.
The perceptual outcomes in the two-dimensional circumplex space were
calculated from the eight scales, relying on the recommendations
outlined in the ISO/TS 12913-3(13) and visualised in the Figure 2 using
the Soundscapy tool (8)

\section{Data \& Methods}\label{sec-data-methods}

\subsection{Ethical statement}\label{ethical-statement}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

\subsection{Task}\label{task}

The experiment consisted of three blocks within which the 27 stimuli
were presented in random order, including a neutral grey environment
without any sounds being reproduced which represented the baseline
scenario. First block featured only auditory stimuli with a neutral grey
environment presented in the HMD, the second block featured only 15s
long video samples similar to (12), while the third block featured both
audio and visual recordings combined. The participants were advised to
take frequent breaks, one within each block but more were allowed upon
request.

\subsection{Laboratory setup}\label{laboratory-setup}

The experiment was conducted in a listening chamber featuring twelve
coaxial active speakers (Genelec 8331) arranged to provide Second Order
Ambisonic playback, while the visual stimuli were delivered via an
Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Head-Mounted Display (HMD), as shown in
Figure 1. The participant was required to be sitting on a highchair with
their head in a ``sweet spot'' -- as close as possible to the point that
is equally distant from the centre of all the twelve speakers.

The questionnaire was deployed within the IVR simulation created in
Unity and operated by a participant via joystick.

\subsection{Pilot experiment}\label{pilot-experiment}

Two pilot experiments were conducted: 1) Investigating the applicability
of the Method A questionnaire to assess the perceived affective quality
of the video scenes without the audio stimuli (12); 2) Optimising the
stimuli selection to cover the full circumplex model associated with the
eight dimensions employed in the Method A.

The first pilot experiment featured 39 different scenes and revealed a
good coverage of the calm and eventful space. The annoying and
uneventful dimensions were not covered which could mean that either
visual context cannot generate a monotonous outcome in an urban space,
or that the dataset is missing more stimuli that would address that
segment of the circumplex space (12).

This led to further twelve field recordings made specifically to target
the annoying, monotonous and uneventful area of the circumplex model.

\subsubsection{Stimuli selection}\label{stimuli-selection}

The second pilot study was focused on providing three scenes per each
section of the circumplex space in a three by three matrix. Three
researchers conducted independent assessments of the 51 videos (the
combined audio and video condition) to select the most representative 27
stimuli. After the independent assessment, the outcome was discussed
until an agreement was reached. The selected scenes are presented in
Table 1.
